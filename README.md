## Overview

This project is an extension of a basic multi-screen Flutter app, implementing more advanced navigation techniques. It covers:

- **Part 1:** Advanced Route Management (Named routes, passing data between screens)
- **Part 2:** Complex Navigation Structure (Bottom navigation bar with separate sections)
- **Part 3:** Dynamic Routing (Generating dynamic screens based on user input)
- **Part 4:** Advanced UI/UX (Custom animations, transitions, and gestures)
- **Part 5:** Error Handling and User Feedback (Handling navigation errors and providing feedback)
- **Part 6:** Documentation and Presentation (Code documentation and summarizing the approach)

## Features

- **Named Routes:** Easily navigate between screens using named routes.
- **Arguments Passing:** Pass data between screens using route arguments.
- **Go Back Button:** Each screen has a button to navigate back to the previous screen.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar:** A navigation bar allows users to switch between different sections of the app.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Users can input a number to generate that number of dynamic screens.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle navigation errors with user feedback via snack bars or custom dialogs.

## Challenges

- **Making good UI/UX**
- **Encountered error:** "if the home property is specified the routes table cannot include an entry for /". Solution removed the home property and use initialRoute with named routes.
